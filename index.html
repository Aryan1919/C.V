                  The tuning , rythm , that lovely sound & offcourse from back then till now I'm used to make notes 
                  of every chords I need to play. <br>
                  My first ever instrument was a piano , on starting days I needed an instructer to guide me a little 
                  & when I realized I have every info I needed so to play my own I left that instructer with respect & started 
                  my way to bring music in my life. <br>
                  I bought my own guitar with my money which I earned by my efforts.

                I was used to be at defender's place back then & our team had many proud moments. <br>
              Beacuse of my college studies I never get time for my team & other players's are also 
            busy in there own life but if somehow our team stand again together it will be my honour

              <p class="coding-para"> 
                For coding, I'll say that it may be look confusing difficult or anything that make you 
                think to quite plan of doing it, but when you'll try understand every bit of code used in program
                you're surely gonna love to do it & also you,ll find it simpler than any other thing.
                <br>
                you've to only do is just sit & start to code no matter you make a samll program or big one , the thing is 
                never stop to work on it. <br>
                If I tell you about me, back then I always used to think ... <br>
               How to do it? <br>
               Where to start from? <br>
               How'll I find the bug hidden inside my code? <br>
               Which lang will gonna be best suited for me?  <br>
               Which datatype I should use & at which place? <br>
               But let me tell you , firstly sit at a quite place & just start to code any of the program of your
              choice , start with a small program then go to big one & no matter which language you try to code on
              , the thing is to get started in it & you'll find the keys of you're every locked door by 
             own & once when you'll find the code run succesfully , you'll find your happiness .  </p>
